# cowsay4reddit
Bot that takes the best part of Linux, and puts it into Reddit

Able to run as a node.js server, and will return a cowsay message upon hearing a Reddit comment in the form "!cowsay <X>". An ascii cow will be displayed saying <X>. Try it out yourself by replacing any env variables with your own Reddit credentials, and change the subreddit destination to something fun.
